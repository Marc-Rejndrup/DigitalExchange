NOTES:
-Had to rename project back to cse305_update
-Code looks like shit, sorry
-Worst naming conventions
-No documentation lol
-Everything's been shoved into certain pages, no ajax is used cause apparently 2006 didn't use it
-Nothing's been renamed to what it should probably be
-Some leftover paragraphs are left in html, we can clean it up later or something
-A bunch of unused files are here
-Feel free to tell me any changes to table you think need to be made, kind of just added stuff as I needed it

What works:
-Clients can make new account (multi-account is not implemented, cause it's fucking stupid)
-Employees can make new account (need to implement differentiation between manager and regular employee, basically employee == manager right now)
-Most of the work done is in the Employee page (aka where you end up after logging into an employee account), which is called FacultyInformation.jsp

TODO and what's done:

3.1 Manager-Level Transactions

The manager should be able to:

Set the share price of a stock (for simulating market fluctuations in a stock's share price) -----DONE-----
-Add, Edit and Delete information for an employee -----DONE-----
-Obtain a sales report for a particular month
-Produce a comprehensive listing of all stocks -----DONE-----
-Produce a list of orders by stock symbol or by customer name -----DONE-----
-Produce a summary listing of revenue generated by a particular stock, stock type, or customer
-Determine which customer representative generated most total revenue
-Determine which customer generated most total revenue
-Produce a list of most actively traded stocks

3.2 Customer-Representative-Level Transactions

Customer Representatives should be thought of as stock brokers and should be able to:

-Record an order -----DONE-----
-Add, Edit and Delete information for a customer
-Produce customer mailing lists
-Produce a list of stock suggestions for a given customer (based on that customer's past orders)

3.3 Customer-Level Transactions

Customers should be thought of as online traders and should be able to easily browse your online trading system on the web and place orders to purchase or sell stocks. In particular, they should be able to place a trailing-stop or hidden-stop conditional order, and place an order to buy or sell stocks at market or close-of-market price. While they will not be permitted to access the database directly, they should be able to retrieve the following information:

A customer's current stock holdings
-The share-price and trailing-stop history for a given conditional order
-The share-price and hidden-stop history for a given conditional order
-The share-price history of a given stock over a certain period of time (e.g., past six months)
-A history of all current and past orders a customer has placed
-Stocks available of a particular type and most-recent order info
-Stocks available with a particular keyword or set of keywords in the stock name, and most-recent order info
-Best-Seller list of stocks
-Personalized stock suggestion list

PROBLEMS:
-I don't know how to do any of this conditional order shit (I don't know how we're going to record share-price history, so the table probably gonna need to change -- TA wrote to use a seperate conditional order table)
-I still don't know the difference between trade, order, and transaction
-Server keeps giving me random times, so when I create a new account or record an order the time is random
